# Products

# Day 1

A controller has already been created called Products. Your job is to develop a number of different views for a List of Products.

1. One view is a list view
2. One view is a tile view
3. One view is a table view

Model classes representing a `Product` have been provided for you. **Do not modify or simplify the model's properties**
for this exercise.

You will need to implement a view to display a list of the products.

The images have been provided in the `etc` folder. You'll need to add them to your Visual Studio Project.

## Day 2

Convert your existing pages to use a shared layout view so that you are not repeating each site template with each page.

Make the list, tile, and table view have clickable links that redirect the user to the product specific detail view. Suggestions include making the image clickable, the product name clickable, etc.

Implement the Detail View for the individual product.
